@CNNPolitics Media is purposely freaking people out about the corona virus in order to hurt Trump by crashing the stock market. Yup.
@RichardCheese @CDCDirector @jimmylovaas Do we have thousands of people who are sick with COVID-19 to test? No.  Some of  people don't have enough virus in nose to get accurate results. False negatives. Too early.  I think this is what the test based on, swabbing areas....not serology.

"The East Asian populations have much higher AFs in the eQTL variants associated with higher ACE2 expression in tissues, which may suggest different susceptibility or response to 2019-nCoV/SARS-CoV-2 from different populations under the similar conditions."
@tkawaja Bet you could get @corona to sponsor
@Takahata101 Until a vaccine can be created and distributed it is definitely worth worrying about. Yes you should get flu shots but understand this: Influenza has a 0.1356% mortality rate as tracked by the CDC for 2017-2018. nCoV is sitting at 2.16%.

@NBCPolitics why are we using this corona virus as a lead story sales tool?
@greycamellias @joshtpm Not sure of this so I looked it up. From what I read cryptic transmission means it is not known how or from whom the virus was transmitted. No answer specific to corona virus but this is what it meant when talking about SARS (different strain of corona).
@realDonaldTrump Thatâ€™s not it at all.  We are the Global leader, I agree with maintaining the safety of our country by reducing travel in and out of the country, give up on â€œborderâ€� talk.  Save the World.  Stop Covid-19 at the source.  Prevent every death, be the hero.  I believe in You.

@MarkDeSaulnier Stop politicizing the COVID-19 outbreak. You are nothing more than a political hack. The Democrats appear to be inciting a pandemic crisis when none exists for pure political reasons. Your statement falls in line with this allegation.

@american_kitty @BernieSanders @RamonaMassachi And youâ€™re right, I misstated that it was a test for corona, but he went to the hospital because of fears of having corona. Itâ€™s sensible to get tested for regular flu first, and these flu tests should be subsidized so anyone can get tested if there is a reasonable fear of corona

Not to be a skeptic and overlook the Corona Virus outbreak, but consider this:\r\n-Coronavirus affects the lungs, much like the flu\r\n-Death counts are currently in China, where respiratory problems are the absolute worse cause poor air conditions
@darrenrovell Did you not read or research it?  Obviously not. Those surveyed shows that 38% wouldn't drink it based on the coronavirus.  It then goes on to say that 4% of those who already drink Corona would stop, whether or not the error is plus or minus 4% has nothing to do with the 38%

@dgbradl @jimcramer Again 117 for DIS isnâ€™t what that company is worth . The fact that it has gone down makes sense but it didnâ€™t get to 150 for no reasons.

@reubing @wmmII88 I believe President Trump. Corona virus only has a 2% fatality rate affecting those already weak. The vast majority recover. Also the transmission rate is very low. It's all hype.
@TNDeptofHealth Could you please make a statement regarding the situation with COVID-19 in TN and how we are currently testing to prevent spread. Would also be helpful to know how our state is preparing.

The name coronavirus is derived from the Latin corona, meaning "crown" or "halo". Being American when I hear corona I think of the human eye. Now the virus has spread to three countries two beginning with the letter "I". The third country, Korea, is similar to cornea.
